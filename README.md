# Overview

I produced a CGI image using blender in which I edit the scenary and linked modules within the software to create ambience and lighting.

I created this because I've always wanted to dabble in CGI work and this was my chance to do so. It is a hobby of mine to watch how movies are made both practically and with computers. I wanted to do something similar here where I create a shot using computer generated graphics.

# Development Environment

Blender - I used blender to create assets and import lighting from the engine to create my own CGI shot.

I did not use a programming language in this software but instead I used modules within the software to create my scene. Blender does use Python however to create its scripts and modules in which I used.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* The lighting is still off and can use some tweaking
* The floor does not seem to have material and depth to it
* I wish to add lighting within the skulls eyes to give more life to it
